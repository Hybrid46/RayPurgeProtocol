Purge Protocol is a retro-style raycaster game inspired by classic first-person shooters like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. Built with C# and Raylib, this project features fast-paced action, enemy AI, and authentic retro visuals with modern rendering techniques.

## Features

    🎮 Classic raycasting engine with smooth movement

    🔫 Enemy AI with pursuit behavior

    🖼️ Authentic pixel art textures and sprites

    ⚡ Performance metrics display

    🗺️ Interactive mini-map

    🎯 Precise crosshair aiming

    🌈 Dynamic lighting and shading effects

## How to Play
Controls

    WASD: Move forward/backward and strafe

    Mouse: Look around, aim and shoot

    Q/E: Quick strafe left/right
