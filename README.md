Purge Protocol is a retro-style raycaster game inspired by classic first-person shooters like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. Built with C# and Raylib, this project features fast-paced action, enemy AI, and authentic retro visuals with modern rendering techniques.

## Features

    üéÆ Classic raycasting engine with smooth movement

    üî´ Enemy AI with pursuit behavior

    üñºÔ∏è Authentic pixel art textures and sprites

    ‚ö° Performance metrics display

    üó∫Ô∏è Interactive mini-map

    üéØ Precise crosshair aiming

    üåà Dynamic lighting and shading effects

## How to Play
Controls

    WASD: Move forward/backward and strafe

    Mouse: Look around, aim and shoot
